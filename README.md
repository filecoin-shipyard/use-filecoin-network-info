@jimpick/use-filecoin-network-info
==================================

## Status

This repository is in a **frozen** state. It is not being maintained or kept in sync with the libraries it depends on. This library was designed for an early version of _go-filecoin_, which is now known as [Venus](https://venus.filecoin.io/). An API client for Lotus can be found at https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-rpc that may be used to build similar functionality. Even though work on this repository has been **shelved**, anyone interested in updating or maintaining this library should express their interest on one Filecoin community conversation mediums: <https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#join-the-community>.
